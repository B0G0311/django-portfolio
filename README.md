# django-portfolio
A blog and portfolio web application built from Django frameworks. 
Used to showcase past projects as well as write blog posts on a variety of topics that seek to be entertained as a muse.
Created as a project to be deployed as an application on Redhats Open Container Platform


## Portfolio
This app is designed to feature projects that have been created as portfolio pieces or personal projects.

## Blog
The purpose of the blog app is to serve as a less formal outlet of work done on my own time.
This could be how I've implemented a certain server application or a hopefully well penned journal on how a specific Linux tool works.
